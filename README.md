# Kings and Pigs - TypeScript

This is a simple 2D game written in TypeScript using a custom ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture, 2D Canvas for rendering & [Planck.js](https://piqnt.com/planck.js) for the physics.

I wrote this game to learn more about TypeScript and ECS architecture as well as try out planck.js. It's not meant to be a full game, but rather a playground for me to experiment with different ideas.

You can play it now! Just go to https://dungeon.bwallberg.com/ and start playing!
